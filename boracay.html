                <h1>Puka Beach</h1>
<p>a popular alternative to
    the party side of Boracay. Much different
    from the other parts of the island, the
    waves here can get a little choppy during
    the day. So, instead of the noise of party-
    goers, all you’ll hear are the natural
    sounds of nature. It’s a good idea to pack
    some snacks, lay out a beach mat, and
    enjoy a picnic while waiting for the
    famous Boracay sunset.</p>

<h2> Ariel's Point</h2>
<p>This Boracay gem is the
    perfect change of scenery from the
    Boracay you’re used to.
    Ariel’s point is most popular for their
    15 meter high “diving boards” where
    adventure junkies can leap off to the
    clear waters below.
    But if you’re not up for the thrill,
    Ariel’s point is still worth the visit.
    Despite its increasing popularity, this
    area has one of the clearest waters
    and richest marine life in Boracay.

<h2> Mount Luho</h2>
<p>the highest point on
    Boracay Island in the Philippines,
    standing at about 195 meters (640 feet)
    above sea level. Known for its stunning
    panoramic views of the surrounding
    beaches and the vibrant blue waters of
    the Sulu Sea, it’s a popular destination
    for both tourists and locals.
    The trek to the summit is relatively easy
    and can be done via a well-marked trail
    or by a short drive. Once at the top, you
    can enjoy breathtaking vistas, especially
    during sunrise and sunset. There are
    also viewing decks and areas for
    relaxation, making it a perfect spot for
    photography and enjoying nature. The
    lush greenery surrounding the mountain
    adds to its charm, creating a serene
    escape from the busy beach scene below.
